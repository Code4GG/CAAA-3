Shackled mind
My mind is in a hard place
 in prison with no parole 
Why?!!!
I canâ€™t seem to configure or decipher what makes me guilty to keep me locked up  
I wander all day zoning out,
Trying to find the key that will unlock the door
But it seems that the harder I try,
The more the chains and locks seem to multiply
I'm trapped in this prison of my own mind
Unable to escape, no matter how hard I try
I long for the freedom to be myself
But these walls, they seem to block everything else
I wish I could break free and find my way
But for now, I'm stuck in this dark place, day by day
I pray for the strength to overcome
And find the courage to move on
But until then, I'll stay trapped in this prison of my own mind
Hoping and praying for a way to unwind
And find my freedom, one step at a time.
